        Your website your storefront online, and should welcome customers in to browse and shop around.
        It should also be sleek and professional-looking. An unimpressive website is as
        much a deterrant to customers as a rundown-looking store.<br/><br/>
        f(x) can build websites to showcase your inventory and staff, integrate with social media
        and marketing campaigns, and much more. Your website can do some of your customer service
        work for you &mdash; e.g. take orders, allow questions, comments or complaints to be submitted,
        etc.<br/><br/>
        We build websites that are beautiful, dependable and hard-working.
